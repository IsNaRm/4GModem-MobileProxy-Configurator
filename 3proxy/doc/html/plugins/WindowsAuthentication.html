
<h3>3proxy Windows Authentication plugin</h3>
Support for cleartext authentication against Windows domain or local Windows account.
<h4>Usage:</h4>
<ol>
 <li>Extract WindowsAuthentication.dll to the same folder with 3proxy executable.
 <li>Create 3ProxyAllowedGroup - Windows system group allowed to use proxy.
 You can choose different group name. Group can be either local or
 Active Directory. Every account allowed to use 3proxy must be included in this
 group either directly or through group nesting.
 <li>Configure plugin with 'plugin' command in 3proxy.cfg, e.g.:
<pre><code>
plugin &quot;WindowsAuthentication.dll&quot; WindowsAuthentication &quot;3ProxyAllowedGroup&quot;
</code></pre>
<br>WindowsAuthentication.dll - location of DLL, if DLL is located in different folder
from 3proxy.exe you must specify complete path to DLL here. 3ProxyAllowedGroup - Windows
system group allowed to use 3proxy.
After plugin is loaded, 'windows' authentication type is supported.

 <li>Configure 'auth windows' for services that require Windows authentication.
 <li>It's recommended you also configure authentication caching (see 'authcache'),
 to prevent excessive workload for domain controller. Example:
<pre>
 authcache user,pass 900
 auth cache windows
</pre>

 <li>NTLM authentication is not currently supported for plugins, you should use proxy -n key to disable it.
</ol>
