<h3>3proxy traffic correction plugin</h3>
3proxy logs and counts traffic on application level, while provider usually does
it on network or link level. It's significant if you use 3proxy for billing,
especially in case where network packets are small, e.g. network games.
<p>
This plugin attempts to correct 3proxy computations to approximate network or
link level traffic by using either fixed coefficients by port number or
attempting to predict number and sizes of network packets.
</p><h4>Usage:</h4>
<ol>
 <li>Extract TrafficPlugin.dll to the same folder with 3proxy executable.
 </li><li>Start plugin in 3proxy.cfg with 
<pre>plugin TrafficPlugin.dll start
</pre>
 </li><li>Add correction rules:
<br>
FOR FIXED COEFFICIENTS MODE:
<pre>trafcorrect m &lt;service&gt; &lt;target port&gt; &lt;coefficient&gt;
</pre>
where &lt;service&gt; - one of proxy, socks4, socks45, socks5, tcppm, udppm, pop3p, * matches "any".
<br> &lt;target port&gt; - target port, * matches any
<br> &lt;coefficient&gt; - coefficient to multiply traffic for this port.
<br>
FOR PACKET HEADER PREDICTION MODE
<pre>trafcorrect p &lt;service&gt; &lt;tcp/udp&gt; &lt;target port&gt; [empty packet size]
</pre>
tcp ot udp - transport level protocol to apply rule
<br>
empty packet size - average size of "empty" packet, that is sum of average network/transport headers.
You can use network sniffer, such is Ethereal to discover it. Usually packet size
is 42 for UDP and 
<br>Modes can be mixed.
<br>Plugin creates a list of rules, first matching rule will be applied.
</li></ol>
For any mode plugin approximates traffic, logged or counted amount is not exact.
<h4>Example:</h4>
<pre>plugin "TrafficPlugin.dll" start
trafcorrect m socks5 6112 4.5
trafcorrect m socks5 * 1.1
</pre>
wrong usage:
<pre>trafcorrect m socks5 * 1.1
trafcorrect m socks5 6112 4.5
</pre>
second rule will never be applied.
<h4>Download:</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Plugin is included into 3proxy 0.6 binary and source distribution
</li></ul>
